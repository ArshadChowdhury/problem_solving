# Opened this repo to solve problems and keep track of it
## I'm attending a lot of interviews now-a-days, if I wanna look back to a problem/solution or take a hint I'd come here.
## Also to have a look at my old code and make improvements if possible, or to keep reminding me of the problems/solutions.

### There's more reasons behind making this repo, interviewers tend to check github activity. This repo will give me some activity to show as I'll be solving at least a few problems almost everyday.
